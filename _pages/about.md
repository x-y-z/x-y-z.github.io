I am a PhD student in Department of Computer Science, Rutgers University. My advisor is
[Abhishek Bhattacharjee](http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/abhishek/).

# Research

My research interests focus on Computer Architecture and Operating Systems,
especially on [Virtual Memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_memory).
Virtual memory is a nice [middle layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indirection)
providing good programmability and performance, but now needs to catch up with
new Heterogenous Memory Systems.

I design efficient [hardware](/publications/2017-06-24-ISCA-2017) and
[software](https://lwn.net/Articles/728154/) to enable the full potential of
new heterogeneous memory systems by accelerating data migration between
different memory nodes in a system.
