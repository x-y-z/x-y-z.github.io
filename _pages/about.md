I am a software engineer at [NVIDIA Research](https://research.nvidia.com).
I got my PhD in computer science from Rutgers University. My PhD advisor was
[Abhishek Bhattacharjee](http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/abhishek/). My Chinese
name is <img src="images/yanzi.png" alt="晏子" style="width:60px;" /> .

# Research

My research interests focus on Computer Architecture and Operating Systems,
especially on [Virtual Memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_memory).
Virtual memory is a nice [middle layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indirection)
providing good programmability and performance, but now needs to catch up with
new Heterogenous Memory Systems.

I design efficient [hardware](/publications/2017-06-24-ISCA-2017) and
[software](https://lwn.net/Articles/728154/) to enable the full potential of
new heterogeneous memory systems by accelerating data migration between
different memory nodes in a system.
